# Solana StackExchange XP System 

Goal: To develop an automated tool which will compute and distribute XP Points to Solana StackExchange contributors and community members. The macro vision can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/chester-king/Instagrant-Proposal-for-Solana-StackExchange-XP-System-574622286d524dfa89180bb41153dba2)

## Why Solana StackExchange XP?

1. In the Web 3.0 community, people with a diverse set of expertise and skillset can be found. With this, it becomes essential to know who has a track record of successful product shipping and who to put your faith & trust into. 
2. This is also the rationale behind the XP System in Superteam to encourage and drive more credibility within the community. 
3. All open source communities aid the development and expansion of an ecosystem. Particularly in the Solana ecosystem, where the majority of the components are actively being developed and tested.
4. To ensure the contributors are recognized and allowed to build their credibility in the ecosystem - Iâ€™d like to propose XP allotment automation tool for the Solana StackExchange.  [https://solana.stackexchange.com/](https://solana.stackexchange.com/)
5. This tool will allow the Solana Developer community to become more robust and result in an overall healthy Solana Developer Community.
